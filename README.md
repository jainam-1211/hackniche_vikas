<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project



The academic document validation system in Iraq is rather complex and slow. Students are also at a risk of losing the certificate.

So, an advanced and unconventional technique is needed to validate academic documents. Blockchain innovation gives a powerful, scalable
and private solution for verification. Blockchain is a decentralized database (distributed ledger)
that records transactions or even digital events that have been executed and shared among the
participating parties.

Our project is a management system for the export and verification of academic certificates. It automates the process of generating certificates and reduces the cost and manual work needed for the verification of the same.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

 to get started and run the project on your computer follow the steps below .

### Prerequisites

this is the things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* node.js from (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* Live Server Extension on vscode Extensions
* Metamask Wallet at (https://metamask.io/download/)
### Installation

1. Clone the repo from github
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/DevAloshe/BlockChain-Based-Documents-Verfication-System-With-IPFS
   ```
3. Inside the project folder install npm packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Copy the Solidity Contract located in the `Contract` folder and deploy it via Remix-Online-IDE ,
   
5. Then  get the contract address and contract abi from Remix-Online-Ide and place it in the `app.js` and `verify.js` files
    ```js
    window.CONTRACT = {
    address: 'Contract Address',
    network: 'the network you deployed the contract at Example: https://polygon-rpc.com/',
    explore: 'Block Explorer Example: https://polygonscan.com/',
    abi: ['Contract ABI']}  
    ```

See the [open issues](https://github.com/DevAloshe/BlockChain-Based-Documents-Verfication-System-With-IPFS/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
